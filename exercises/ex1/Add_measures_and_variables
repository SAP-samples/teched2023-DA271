Add calculated & restricted measures. (Note: Point out that in large organization its crucial to agree on common definition of KPIs. This is helpful for their reuse (saves time) and governance (we all use same definitions)  

User steps 

Add calculated measure Average Price (AVG_PRICE) as GROSSAMOUNT / QUANTITY 

Add restricted measures 

Domestic Gross Sales (DOMESTIC_GROSSAMOUNT) based on measure GROSSAMOUNT and with restriction as COUNTRY = 'DE' 

International Gross Sales (INTL_GROSSAMOUNT) based on measure GROSSAMOUNT and with restriction as COUNTRY != 'DE' 

Add Filter Variable YEAR w settings multi-value, no default, not mandatory  
Note: explain that many users will want to see only the current year. This way the system pre-filters on the current year. The same could be true for e.g. own region. Explain that other variable types exist also (w link to docu)  

Save & deploy 

Preview data and confirm empty prompt. Check new calculations (e.g. drill by country)  

Redo prompt (button exists!) and filter on 2023. Confirm data is now filtered (e.g. by taking YEAR into drill-down)
