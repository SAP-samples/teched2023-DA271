Showcase features count distinct & constant selection 

Add restricted measure All Countries (ALL_COUNTRIES_GROSSAMOUNT) based on measure GROSSAMOUNT and w empty expression. Activate constant selection on dimension COUNTRY 
Note: Explain that constant selection ensures that a given dimension is taken out of drill-down even it actually is part of drill-down. This is important to compute reference figures (like e.g. here all countries). We could also have used a variable and used it in the restriction expression to make the list of reference countries configurable (optional exercise w/o guide)  

Add calculated measure Share of Sales (SHARE_OF_SALES) w expression 100 * GROSS_AMOUNT / ALL_COUNTRIES_GROSSAMOUNT  

Add count distinct measure Customer Count (CUSTOMER_CNT) based on Dimension PARTNERID 

Add calculated measure Avg Spend per Customer (AVG_GROSSAMOUNT_PER_CUSTOMER) w expression GROSSAMOUNT / CUSTOMER_CNT
