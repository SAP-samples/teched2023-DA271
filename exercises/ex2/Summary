We started the exercise by importing a couple of tables that had been superficially wired up for us as a fact with a couple of dimensions around it. We prepared a rich data model for our analytics users and touched a multitude of functionalities on the way:

## System setup

-   Replication flow for efficient and parallel onboarding of many source tables

-   Semantic basics around facts, dimensions and associations

-   ER model for efficient object overview

-   Data lineage & dependency lineage of repository entities

## Analytic model

-   Dimension & attribute selection

-   Measure modelling for calculated measures, restricted measures, constant selection, count distinct & automatic currency conversion

## Labels & internationalization

-   Language-independent labels to fields

-   Language-dependent labels via own text entities that get associated to dimensions via text associations

## Hierarchy modelling

-   Level-based hierarchies

-   Classic parent-child hierarchies

-   Hierarchies with directories to get

    -   data-driven hierarchy definition

    -   support of text nodes

    -   language-dependent labels for nodes & hierarchies

    -   time-dependent hierarchies

## Currency conversion

-   Adding currency & unit semantics to data layer artefacts

-   Import of currency conversion data from SAP S/4 into SAP Datasphere

-   Task chains for parallel execution of multiple data flows

-   Data integration monitor for inspection of task chain runs

-   Currency conversion measures in Analytic Model

Thanks for your dedication and interest in SAP Datasphere modelling. Best regards, the SAP Datasphere Product Management Team
