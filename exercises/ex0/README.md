# Getting Started - Preparing your system

**Section Goal:** Load all required data & models that are the base line for the following exercises. 

We have prepared a simple data model to analyze product sales for a typical company. For this exerise we will simply load this model with connections to the associated data from a CSN file so we can focus on the Analytic Model.

If you want to learn how to create data layer ER models like this, go here...


## Steps

Download CSN from Github **[link]**

Create new replication flow RF_IMPORT_BASETABLES to import all relevant tables from HANA Cloud connection DSP1_OPENSAP 
 
**Screenshot**
Deploy & run the replication flow  

Import CSN  

Open ER Model 


Now your initial ER should look like this

Inspect details in ER Model (contained objects, their inner workings)  

## Summary

Now that you have your data and data model uploaded, we can continue to data modeling.
